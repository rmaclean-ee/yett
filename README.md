# Hi

This takes the original [Yett](https://github.com/elbywan/yett) and makes the following changes:

1. Blacklist renamed to blocklist.
2. Whitelist is totally removed.
3. There is no unblock functionality.
4. There is no checking for variables - it needs to be put in the variables.js and built to be blocked.

Goal is to be super light (already is 75% smaller), self sufficient and fast.
